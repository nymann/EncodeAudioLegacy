## Challenge

You're involved in a new project called encode audio. As this project starts to be too difficult to maintain and evolve
you become the expert, and you're in charge to save it through refactoring. As a craftsman, you decide to start by writing
unit tests in order to reach 100% code coverage. But as usual, you have little time to do it - a few hours max.

The future of the project is in your hands. Good luck!
